   Measure and alert on your SLIs <practice-reliability/slis>
   Respond to incidents <practice-reliability/incident-response>
   Scale your system's observability through collaboration <practice-reliability/collaboration>
   Set up Observability Cloud <setup-o11y/setup-o11y>


With the Splunk platform, you can manually perform tasks to maintain or increase the reliability of your systems through Splunk searches and log analysis. With Splunk Observability Cloud, on the other hand, you can dig deeper into those search results:

- Correlate logs with metrics and traces to locate, isolate, and resolve problems in your applications or infrastructure quickly.

- Use hundreds of prepackaged integrations to start monitoring your entire deployment immediately.

- Improve mean time to resolution using prepackaged and custom alerts and detectors.

Use Observability Cloud to solve common system reliability problems. For example, do you have a wide variety of platforms, databases, and cloud services that you must monitor in multiple interfaces? Observability Cloud has hundreds of prepackaged integrations that give you a predefined view with a single pane of glass for hybrid coverage.

Are you moving into the cloud and Kubernetes environments, requiring your teams to react to a magnitude of changes very quickly? The cloud-native data and analytics scale in Observability Cloud is built for Kubernetes and cloud environments. 


Five core principles underpin system reliability: availability, performance, monitoring, incident response, and preparation. See the Splunk Blogs post :new-page:`What is site reliability engineering? <https://www.splunk.com/en_us/data-insider/what-is-site-reliability-engineering.html#:~:text=Site%20reliability%20engineering%20(SRE)%20is,production%20systems%20and%20solve%20problems.>` for more information. But you don't have to be a Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) to maintain system reliability with Observability Cloud. Reliability involves measuring your system through its telemetry, alerting you on outages and failures of your infrastructure, and guiding you with dashboards to inform your journey to isolating and resolving problems. 

Select each of the following categories to learn how you can maintain reliability with Observability Cloud:

* :ref:`Measure and alert on your SLIs <practice-reliability-slis>`

* :ref:`Respond to incidents <practice-reliability-incident-response>`

* :ref:`Collaborate on observability within and across teams <practice-reliability-collaboration>`


Then see :ref:`setup-o11y-setup-o11y` to get started.
