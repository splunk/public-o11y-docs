   :description: Learn to use the AI Assistant in Observability Cloud.

The AI Assistant in Observability Cloud provides fast, deep insights that leverage observability data (metrics, traces, logs, and alerts). Users can access these insights in an intuitive chat interface within their existing workflow in Splunk Observability Cloud.

You can use the AI Assistant to do the following:

* Get quick insights into your metrics, charts, traces, incident alerts, dashboards, services, and errors

* Troubleshoot faster in Splunk APM and Splunk Infrastructure Monitoring

* Search metrics, charts, and alerts

* Generate SignalFlow based on your question in natural language

The AI Assistant provides an intelligent chatbot experience to empower users to craft complex SignalFlow by simply writing plain English prompts.

The AI Assistant has access only to data from Splunk APM and Splunk Infrastructure Monitoring. While you can access the AI Assistant throughout Splunk Observability Cloud, responses are geared toward use cases for APM, Infrastructure Monitoring, and Log Observer Connect.

      <h2>Context limitations<a name="context-limitations" class="headerlink" href="#context-limitations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
    </embed>

Context length is the amount of text that the AI Assistant can process in a single conversation due to LLM limitations. Think of it as the short-term memory of the AI Assistant. Each interaction with the AI Assistant is limited to the context set from the beginning of that conversation. The AI Assistant tells you when you exceed the chat limit and prompts you to copy the information that you want to save and start a new chat to continue. Select the :guilabel:`New chat` button in the upper right corner of the AI Assistant to create a new chat with a new context.

   * - :strong:`Category`
     - :strong:`Description`

   * - Grounding observability data
     - Refers to observability metrics, traces, and logs data. Not every user prompt may require grounding observability data. For environment-specific questions like “What is wrong with my payment service?”, the AI Assistant leverages payment service-related observability data to answer the question.

     - Refer to the output generated by the AI Assistant. This might contain observability data in a summarized text chart form. 
   * - Feedback
     - Refers to any user-entered feedback.

     - Usage data is more fully described in the Splunk Privacy Statement. Examples include “thumbs up”, “thumbs down”, “chat id”, “copy”, “tokens used”, and “response length”. 

When you use the AI Assistant, Splunk relies on certain essential types of data to provide the service and to enforce compliance with Splunk policy and applicable law; this includes user inputs, outputs, grounding observability data, and usage data (“essential purposes”). If you use the AI Assistant in Observability Cloud, you are agreeing to the essential purposes.

In addition to the essential purposes, you also have the option of allowing Splunk to use the data collected by the AI Assistant for the additional purpose of conducting research and development on the AI Assistant and generative AI in general. This use of your data is optional, and you can choose to allow or disallow it by updating your settings. To manage your AI Assistant settings, follow these steps:

1. Go to :guilabel:`Settings` in Splunk Observability Cloud. 

2. On the :guilabel:`General Organization Settings` page, go to the :guilabel:`AI Assistant Management` section and select or deselect :guilabel:`AI Assistant in Observability` to activate or deactivate the AI Assistant in Observability Cloud for your organization. Note that any use of the AI Assisstant in Observability Cloud requires Splunk's use of your data for the essential purposes. If you do not wish to allow Splunk to use your data for the essential purposes, do not activate the AI Assistant or otherwise use the AI Assistant in Observability Cloud.

3. If you do not want to allow usage of your data for research and development, deselect :guilabel:`Allow my AI service data to be used for research and development purposes`.
