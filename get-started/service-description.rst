.. _sd-data:

Data ingestion and retention
===========================================================

Splunk Observability Cloud provides software and APIs that allow you to ingest data from your on-premises infrastructure, applications, user interfaces, cloud services, servers, network devices, and more. Splunk Observability Cloud provides guided setups that help you install and configure OpenTelemetry instrumentation. See :ref:`get-started-get-data-in` for more information.

.. note::
   All editions of Splunk Observability Cloud include Log Observer Connect, which let you analyze logs you've ingested to Splunk Cloud Platform and Splunk Enterprise at no additional cost. See :ref:`lo-connect-landing` for more information.

Splunk OpenTelemetry Collector
-----------------------------------------------------------

The Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector is an open-source software agent capable of collecting traces, metrics, and logs from a wide variety of hosts, containers, and services. You are responsible for installing, configuring, transforming, sending data, and managing your Collector instances, including maintaining version compatibility and installing, configuring, and managing Collector components. See :ref:`otel-intro` for more information.

Splunk provides support for the Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector. See :ref:`using-upstream-otel` for more information.


Integration with cloud service providers
------------------------------------------------------------

You can configure Splunk Observability Cloud to connect to services in AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud Platform to retrieve metrics and logs. See :ref:`get-started-connect` for more information.

Splunk instrumentation can help you instrument serverless applications to bring traces and application metrics to Splunk Observability Cloud. See :ref:`instrument-serverless-functions`.

Splunk distributions of OpenTelemetry instrumentation
-----------------------------------------------------------

The Splunk distributions of OpenTelemetry instrumentation are open-source software agents and libraries that can instrument back-end applications and front-end experiences for Splunk APM and Splunk RUM. Setup, configuration, transformation, and sending data from the instrumentation agents and libraries is your responsibility, including maintaining version compatibility and installing, configuring, and managing automatic and manual instrumentations. See :ref:`get-started-application` and :ref:`rum-gdi` for more information.

Splunk officially supports the Splunk distributions of OpenTelemetry instrumentation, including manual instrumentation.


Ingest API endpoints
-------------------------------------------------------------

You can use the REST API to send telemetry directly to Splunk Observability Cloud. This might be useful when you can't use the Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector or when you have specific networking or security requirements. See :ref:`rest-api-ingest` for more information. If your organization has stringent networking security policies that apply to sending data to third parties, see :ref:`allow-services`.


Private connectivity
-------------------------------------------------------------

If you prefer not to send data to Splunk public endpoints using HTTPS, you can use AWS Private Link to ingest data from sources deployed on AWS. See :ref:`aws-privatelink` for more information.


Data retention
-------------------------------------------------------------

When you send data to Splunk Observability Cloud, it is ingested and stored for a period of time that varies depending on the product and type of contract. See :ref:`data-o11y` for more information.

You can monitor subscription usage for each product depending on the type of subscription. See :ref:`subscription-overview` for more information.

.. _sd-subscriptions:

Subscription types, expansions, renewals, and terminations
===========================================================

Your subscription to Splunk Observability Cloud depends on the Splunk product: host-based or usage-based for Splunk IM and Splunk APM, or web sessions for Splunk RUM or synthetics check for Splunk Synthetic Monitoring.

Host-based subscriptions
------------------------------------------------------------

Host-based subscriptions base billing on the total number of unique hosts reporting data to Splunk Observability Cloud on an hourly basis, then calculate the average of those hourly measurements across each billing month. The calculation is done for each host, container, custom metric, and high resolution metric. A host is a physical, non-virtualized environment, or a virtual instance in a virtualized or public cloud environment, that reports metric data to Splunk Observability Cloud. You can increase the amount of hosts or containers per host if needed.

Usage-based subscription
---------------------------------------------

Usage-based pricing is suited for custom metrics, containerized environments, and monitoring serverless environments or cloud services that don't provide a view of underlying hosts. Usage is calculated depending on the product or feature. For example, Splunk Infrastructure Monitoring usage-based pricing relies on metric time series (MTS), whereas Splunk Real User Monitoring calculates usage from the number of web sessions. For more information on subscription usage and monitoring in Splunk Observability Cloud, see :ref:`subscription-overview`.

Overages
----------------------------------------------

Splunk Observability Cloud overages are based on usage measured over a month. Overages are incurred if the monthly usage is higher than your paid subscription. Splunk Observability Cloud provides transparent usage data with granular daily detailed reports on all monitored hosts, containers, and metrics. You can also turn on alerts or setup tokens to manage your usage. See :ref:`subscription-overview` for more information.

.. _sd-suites:

Suite offerings
-----------------------------------------------

Splunk Observability Cloud is also available in different suites, including Splunk Observability Cloud Enterprise Edition and Splunk Observability Cloud Commercial Edition. See :new-page:`Suites <https://www.splunk.com/en_us/legal/suitification-licensing.html>` on Splunk.com for more information.

.. _sd-subscription:

Subscription updates, renewals, and terminations
---------------------------------------------------

You can update or expand your Splunk Observability Cloud subscription any time during the term of the subscription to meet your business needs. For example, you can:

- Increase host-based or usage-based capacity.
- Add products and features to your subscription.
- Upgrade to enterprise edition licensing with Service Bureau features.

Splunk Observability Cloud informs about the need for renewal through a banner that appears 15 days prior to the subscription expiration date. For more information on subscription renewals, contact your Splunk sales representative.

On expiration date, a 15-day grace period starts. During the grace period, users see a banner when logging in reminding them of the expiration. After the grace period, the subscription enters suspended mode, which lasts 30 days and during which users can't log in. After the 30 day suspension, the account is terminated and the data stored on the account is deleted.
