**Splunk On-Call Version Required: Starter / Growth** for **Single Room,
Enterprise** for **Multi-Room**

**What you need to know: Multi-Room requires the Rules Engine and
Webhooks i.e. Splunk On-Call Enterprise**

[/ht_toggle]

This bi-directional integration between HipChat and Splunk On-Call
(formerly called VictorOps) allows you to fight fires from either
platform and never miss a beat. All messages entered in the Splunk
On-Call timeline, including alerts, on-call changes, escalations and
chats will appear in the HipChat room, and vice versa.

This article provides step by step instructions for setting up the
integration for a Single Room or Multi-Room configuration.

--------------

**Single Room**
===============

**In Splunk On-Call**
---------------------

In Splunk On-Call, select *Integrations >> Hipchat*\ **.**

If the integration has not yet been enabled, click the *Enable
Integration* button to generate your endpoint URL.  Be sure to replace
the “$routing_key” section with the actual routing key you intend to
use. (To view or configure route keys in VictorOps, click *Alert
Behavior >> Route Keys*)

Copy the *Add-on Capabilities URL* that is generated by enabling the
integration.

--------------

**In HipChat**
--------------

From your online HipChat homepage, select *Integrations*.

Scroll down the alphabetized list and search for VictorOps. The
integration within HipChat is stilled called VictorOps, even though the
product name has changed to Splunk On-Call: |hip5|

From the integration menu for VictorOps, select the *Install an
integration from a descriptor url* option:

   hip6

Paste the *Add-on Capabilities URL* that you got from your Splunk
On-Call HipChat integration page into the *Descriptor URL* box, then
click *Install*.

Next, choose the chat room that will be associated with VictorOps /
Splunk On-Call: **hip8**

Finally, click *Install*:

.. figure:: images/hip9.png
   :alt: hip9

   hip9

That's it!

The final step is to test the integration by posting an entry to the
HipChat room you chose and make sure that it appears in your Splunk
On-Call timeline, and vice versa.

--------------

**Multi-Room**
==============

The Multi-Room version of the HipChat integration builds upon what is
achievable with the Single Room HipChat configuration - allowing
messages/events to be directed to multiple HipChat rooms accordingly.
This is achieved through the leveraging of the Rules Engine and Custom
Outgoing Webhooks, both of which are Enterprise level features.

.. _in-hipchat-1:

**In HipChat**
--------------

Start by creating a custom integration.
Select *Integrations* then *Build your own integration*.

.. figure:: images/multi1.png
   :alt: multi1

   multi1

Select the room you want to create the integration for and give the
integration a name.

.. figure:: images/multi2.png
   :alt: multi2

   multi2

A URL will be generated that allows you to “Send messages to this room
by posting to this URL”. Copy this URL to your clipboard. The URL
contains two items we will need to use in later parts of this article,
the room ID and the authentication token. Find them in bold here:

https://**YOUR_DOMAIN**.hipchat.com/v2/room/**ROOM_ID**/notification?auth_token=\ **AUTH_TOKEN_HERE**

Save your new custom integration.

--------------

.. _in-splunk-on-call-1:

**In Splunk On-Call**
---------------------

First we will setup a Rules Engine rule that will add the room ID and
authentication token to the alerts you want sent into the specified
room. In this example we are setting the room_id field and auth_token
field when we match on the routing key “devops”. |multi3|

This will allow you to change the room_id and auth_token depending on
the type of alert. In the example we match on the routing key “devops”
but you can match on any alert field.

Next we will need to set up an `Outbound
Webhook <https://help.victorops.com/knowledge-base/custom-outbound-webhooks/>`__
to send Splunk On-Call information to your HipChat room(s).

From the Splunk On-Call timeline select Integrations *>> Outgoing
Webhooks >>* *Add Webhook*.

Select the “Event” you want to forward to HipChat, in our example we are
sending a message every time an incident is triggered.

Set the *Method* to “POST”.

Set the *Content Type* to “application/json”

For the To address paste in your HipChat room endpoint. If you are
sending to multiple rooms based on alert type, you will need to replace
the “room id” and “auth token” variables with the alert fields you
created in the Rules Engine. For example:

https://**YOUR_DOMAIN**.hipchat.com/v2/room/:math:`{{ALERT.room\_id}}/notification?auth\_token=`\ {{ALERT.auth_token}}

For the payload section, you can add a number of different variables.
For more information see the HipChat documentation
`here <https://www.hipchat.com/docs/apiv2/method/send_room_notification>`__.
In our example we are sending a simple colored message that contains
alert information found in the “entity_display_name” field.

{ “color”: “red”, “message”: “${{ALERT.entity_display_name}}”, “notify”:
true, “message_format”: “text” }

The final result should look something like:

Additional webhooks can be created for other events in the Splunk
On-Call system. If you have any questions please reach out to Splunk
On-Call support.
