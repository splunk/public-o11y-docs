Manual Take On-Call
===================

Manual Take On-Call is an action you can perform in VictorOps to take
someone’s on-call shift from them with just a few clicks! Rather than
manipulating the entire team’s schedule or creating a scheduled
override, Manual Take On-Call provides the one-off functionality for
your on-call teams to swap/change personnel in real-time. 

How does it Work?
-----------------

A Manual Take On-Call allows one user to take on-call responsibilities
from another user. This can be done by navigating to the People Pane
within the Timeline.

Click into the desired user’s card. Locate the Escalation Policy for
which you wish to take on-call responsibilities. Click the *Take Shift*
button in line with the appropriate Escalation Policy and respond to the
confirmation prompt to take the on-call responsibility from that user,
for that team.

Clear Take
~~~~~~~~~~

After you have manually taken a shift you, and the individual that you
took on-call for, both have the option to *Clear Take*. This button will
appear next to the escalation policy both in your user profile card and
the other individual’s user profile card.

 

Take Back
~~~~~~~~~

If someone takes a shift from you, you have the option to *Take Back*
that shift, effectively ending that take. The *Take Back* button will
appear next to the escalation policy in your profile card and that of
the person who took from you.

Things to Note
--------------

Hard-coded User in the Escalation policy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you *Take On-call* for a user who is hard-coded in the first step
of an Escalation Policy (i.e., they are in a *Notify User* step),
VictorOps imposes a 30 day limit on the take. The end day/time will
appear in the descriptive text beneath the escalation policy that you
took on-call for in the user profile card.

Take On-call in the Calendar View
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Another thing to know: a *Take On-call* is denoted by a strikethrough in
the main calendar as opposed to the colored bar associated with
`Scheduled
Overrides <https://help.victorops.com/knowledge-base/scheduled-overrides/>`__.
