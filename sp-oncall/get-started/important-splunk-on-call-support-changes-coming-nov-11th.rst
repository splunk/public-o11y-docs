IMPORTANT Splunk On-Call Support Changes
----------------------------------------

Thank you for being a valued Splunk customer. We are excited to share
some enhancements to the Support Experience.

The Splunk On-Call (formerly VictorOps) Support `contact
page <https://victorops.com/contact/>`__ is moving to join the `Splunk
Support Portal. <https://login.splunk.com/>`__  You’ll receive the same
world-class support from your Splunk On-Call Support Engineers. 

PLEASE NOTE:  This migration will NOT affect your login and access to
your Splunk On-Call (formerly VictorOps) instance. On November 11th,
end-users may contact Splunk On-Call Support via the following methods:

**1.**  **Live Chat:** If you are logged into your Splunk On-Call
instance, you will have the ability to Live Chat with the Splunk On-Call
Support team.

**2.**  **Splunk Support Portal:** You can open a Splunk On-Call support
case in the Splunk Support Portal:https://login.splunk.com/

**IMPORTANT CHANGES:**   1.  **CREATE A SPLUNK LOGIN**:  When accessing
Splunk Support Portal for the first time, `you will need to create a new
Splunk
login <https://www.splunk.com/en_us/page/sign_up?redirecturl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.splunk.com%2Fen_us>`__.
It’s an easy process, and you can take that action now:

1. Visit the `Splunk Support Portal <https://login.splunk.com/>`__ 

2. Select “sign up”

3. Fill out the form on the far right under “Create Your Splunk Account”

4. **CREATING A CASE:**  Starting on **November 11th**, you must log in
   to the Splunk Support Portal to create a Splunk On-Call Support Case.
   You may also chat with Support from the new chat widget within our
   product. Live Chat with a Technical Support Engineer will open an
   On-Call Support case. 

-  If you email Splunk On-Call Support after this change, you will
   receive an automated email pointing you towards the Splunk Support
   portal.
