   :description: Enable Splunk On-Call SSO for Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS) your organization. 

Requirements
==================

This integration is compatible with the following versions of Splunk On-Call:

- Full-Stack

To enable single sign-on (SSO) for your organization, you will need to provide an updated metadata file and your IDP. If you are interested in setting up SSO, please contact :ref:`Splunk On-Call Support <spoc-support>`.

Our standard SSO setup uses SAML 2.0 protocol. As long as your IDP can use SAML 2.0 protocol, it can integrate with Splunk On-Call. The exact steps differ depending on which IDP you use, but the process typically involves exporting a .XML metadata file and sending it to our Support team. Once you have sent the .xml file, a Splunk On-Call support specialist will
complete the setup on the back-end and respond with confirmation.

If your IDP does not have SAML capability, please contact Splunk On-Call Support to explore what alternative options may be available. For details on how to contact Splunk On-Call Support, see :ref:`spoc-support`.

#. (Optionally) Configure multi-factor authentication. This is not necessary for functionality, but may be required for your organization's security

the configuration up to compliance.

#. Select :guilabel:`Permit all users to access this relying party`, then select :guilabel:`Next`.
