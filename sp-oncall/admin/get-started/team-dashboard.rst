   :description: Splunk On-Call system requirements, including browsers, mobile support, and incident requirements.



The Splunk On-Call provides a comprehensive overview of incidents. This view automatically defaults to the teams that you are a member of and allows teams to dive into the details and understand the status of alerts or incidents. 

All incidents derived from integrated monitoring tools in the incident table include their respective logos to help you rapidly identify the source of an alert. Manually created incidents, along with incidents originating from the Email Endpoint or the REST API integrations, will remain logo free.

Information Alerts can still be found on the Timeline Page.

Filters
===========

The filters provide an easy way for you to see exactly what you are looking for and nothing else. Whether you want to filter by team or by incident state, these filters allow for you to see only what is relevant to you. You can filter the incident table first by team status (with default team associations), as well as incident state.

Incident Table
===================

Quickly identify responsible parties during a firefight by easily seeing which policies are being paged, take action on an incident (acknowledge, add responder, reroute, snooze, resolve), and see the status of incidents. You can also find annotation counts, chats, and associated alerts.
