:strong:`Effective September 29th, 2023`:

As you may know, we are all experiencing increased restrictions and regulations between the U.S. and China. As a company, Splunk has decided to no longer provide voice call notifications to responders in the  +86 country code (China), effective :strong:`September 29th, 2023`.

In response, affected end-users are encouraged to configure :ref:`personal paging policies <personal-paging>` to diversify their Splunk On-Call notification methods (i.e., SMS, Push, and Email notification methods). Please note that the Splunk On-Call product continues to be supported globally, and all functionality will be available to customers with responders outside of the +86 country code (China). 

Again, please be advised that we have deprecated Splunk On-Call voice call notification service for +86
country code (China) effective on September 29th, 2023. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.
