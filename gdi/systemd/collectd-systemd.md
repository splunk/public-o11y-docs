<meta name="description" content="Use this Splunk Observability Cloud integration for the Collectd Systemd monitor. See benefits, install, configuration, and metrics">

## Description

The {ref}`Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector <otel-intro>` provides this integration as the `collectd/systemd` monitor type for the Smart Agent Receiver.

Use this integration to collect metrics about the state of configured systemd services.

This monitor is available on Kubernetes and Linux.

### Benefits

```{include} /_includes/benefits.md
```

### Requirements

This integration reads the status of systemd services from `/var/run/dbus/system_bus_socket`. You must mount the host location to the container in which the Collector or the Smart Agent is running. The agent container must also run in privileged mode. The following example shows an excerpt of the `docker run` command:

```yaml
docker run ...\
  --privileged \
  -v /var/run/dbus/system_bus_socket:/var/run/dbus/system_bus_socket:ro \
...
```

##  Installation

```{include} /_includes/collector-installation-linux.md
```

## Configuration

```{include} /_includes/configuration.md
```

```{note}
Provide a systemd monitor entry in your your Collector or Smart Agent (deprecated) configuration. Use the appropriate form for your agent type.
```

### Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector

To activate this monitor in the Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector, add the following to your agent configuration:

```yaml
receivers:
  smartagent/systemd:
    type: collectd/systemd
    ...  # Additional config
```

To complete the monitor activation, you must also include the `smartagent/systemd` receiver item in a `metrics` pipeline. To do this, add the receiver item to the `service` > `pipelines` > `metrics` > `receivers` section of your configuration file. For example:

```yaml
service:
  pipelines:
    metrics:
      receivers: [smartagent/systemd]
```

### Smart Agent

To activate this monitor in the Smart Agent, add the following to your agent configuration:

```yaml
monitors:  # All monitor config goes under this key
 - type: collectd/systemd
   ...  # Additional config
```

The following is an excerpt of a YAML configuration for monitoring the state of `docker` and `ubuntu-fan` services:

```yaml
monitors:
- type: collectd/systemd
  intervalSeconds: 10
  services:
    - docker
    - ubuntu-fan
```

By default, the `gauge.substate.running` metrics, which indicates whether a service is running or not, is the only metric reported. Configure additional metrics using the `sendActiveState`, `sendSubState`, and `sendLoadState` configuration flags, as shown in the following example:

```yaml
monitors:
- type: collectd/systemd
  intervalSeconds: 10
  services:
    - docker
    - ubuntu-fan
  sendActiveState: true
```

See {ref}`smart-agent` for an autogenerated example of a YAML configuration file, with default values where applicable.

### Configuration settings

The following table shows the configuration options for this monitor:

| Option| Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `services` | Yes | `list of strings` | Services to report on. |
| `sendActiveState` | No | `bool` | Flag for sending metrics about the state of systemd services. The default value is `false`. |
| `sendSubState` | No | `bool` | Flag for sending more detailed metrics about the state of systemd services. The default value is `false`. |
| `sendLoadState` | No | `bool` | Flag for sending metrics about the load state of systemd services. The default value is `false`. |

A service is in the state that a metric represents if the metric value is `1` and not in that state if the metric value is `0`. The integration assigns the name of monitored services to the `systemd_service` dimension.

## Metrics
