## Description

The {ref}`Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector <otel-intro>` provides this integration as the `couchdb` monitor via the Smart Agent receiver. It monitors metrics from CouchDB instances by calling the `_stats` endpoint for instances.

## Installation

1. Deploy the Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector to your host or container platform.
2. Download [collectd-couchdb](https://github.com/signalfx/collectd-couchdb) in GitHub.
3. Move the `couchdb_plugin.py` file to `/usr/share/collectd/collectd-couchdb`.
4. Modify the [sample configuration file](https://github.com/signalfx/integrations/blob/master/collectd-couchdb/10-couchdb.conf) for the plugin in `/etc/collectd/managed_config` according to the [Configuration](#configuration) section.
5. Install the Python requirements:

   ```
   $ sudo pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
6. Restart the OpenTelemetry collector.

## Configuration

The Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector allows embedding a Smart Agent monitor configuration in an associated Smart Agent Receiver instance.

**Note:** Providing a CouchDB monitor entry in your Smart Agent or Collector configuration is required for its use. Use the appropriate form for your agent type.

### Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector

To activate this monitor in the Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector, add the following to your agent configuration:

```yaml
receivers:
  smartagent/couchdb:
    type: couchdb
    ...  # Additional config
```

To complete the monitor activation, you must also include the `smartagent/couchdb` receiver item in a `metrics` pipeline. To do this, add the receiver item to the `service` > `pipelines` > `metrics` > `receivers` section of your configuration file.

See <a href="https://github.com/signalfx/splunk-otel-collector/tree/main/examples" target="_blank">configuration examples</a> for specific use cases that show how the Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector can integrate and complement existing environments.

### Smart Agent

To activate this monitor in the Smart Agent, add the following to your agent configuration:
```
monitors:  # All monitor config goes under this key
 - type: couchdb
   ...  # Additional config
```

See <a href="https://docs.splunk.com/Observability/gdi/smart-agent/smart-agent-resources.html#configure-the-smart-agent" target="_blank">Smart Agent example configuration</a> for an autogenerated example of a YAML configuration file, with default values where applicable.
