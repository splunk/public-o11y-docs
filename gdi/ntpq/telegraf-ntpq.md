<meta name="description" content="Documentation on the telegraf/ntpq monitor">

## Description

The {ref}`Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector <otel-intro>` provides this integration as the `telegraf/ntpq` monitor type using the Smart Agent Receiver. This is an embedded form of the Telegraf NTPQ plugin and requires the `ntpq` executable available on the path of the agent.

Use this integration to retrieve metrics from NTPQ.

This monitor is available on Kubernetes, Linux, and Windows.

##  Installation

```{include} /_includes/collector-installation.md

## Configuration

```

```{note}
Provide a Telegraf NTPQ monitor entry in your Smart Agent or Collector configuration. Use the appropriate form for your agent type.
```

### Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector

To activate this monitor in the Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector, add the following to your agent configuration:

```yaml
receivers:
  smartagent/ntpq:
    type: telegraf/ntpq
    ...  # Additional config
```

To complete the monitor activation, you must also include the `smartagent/ntpq` receiver item in a `metrics` pipeline. To do this, add the receiver item to the `service` > `pipelines` > `metrics` > `receivers` section of your configuration file. For example:

```yaml
service:
  pipelines:
    metrics:
      receivers: [smartagent/ntpq]
```

```{note}
Include monitors with event-sending functionality as members of a `logs` pipeline that utilizes an exporter that makes the event submission requests. Use a Resource Detection processor to ensure that host identity and other useful information is made available as event dimensions.
```

### Smart Agent
To activate this monitor in the Smart Agent, add the following to your agent configuration:

```yaml
monitors:  # All monitor config goes under this key
 - type: telegraf/ntpq
   ...  # Additional config
```

See {ref}`smart-agent` for an autogenerated example of a YAML configuration file, with default values where applicable.

### Configuration settings

The following table shows the configuration options for this monitor:

| Option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `dnsLookup` | No | `bool` | If set to `false`, set the `-n ntpq` flag. Disabling DNS lookups can reduce metric gather time. The default value is `true`. |
