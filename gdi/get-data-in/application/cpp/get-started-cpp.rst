    Migrate from the Splunk instrumentation for C++ <migrate-from-splunk-cpp>

You can send application traces and metrics from your C++ applications to Splunk Observability Cloud using the OpenTelemetry instrumentation for C++.

To learn how to instrument your C++ applications, see :ref:`instrument-cpp`.

.. note:: 

    The Splunk instrumentation for C++ has been deprecated as of March 15, 2024, and it will reach end of support on September 15, 2025. If you're using the Splunk instrumentation, you can migrate to the upstream OpenTelemetry C++ instrumentation. To learn how, see :ref:`migrate-from-splunk-cpp`.
