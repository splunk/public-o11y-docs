   :description: Write custom instrumentation for your Go application when you need to add custom attributes to spans or want to manually generate spans.

Instrumenting applications using the Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Go covers most needs. Writing custom instrumenting your application is only necessary when, for example, you need to add custom attributes to spans or need to manually generate spans.

For instructions on how to write custom Go instrumentation, see the Manual instrumentation docs in the OpenTelemetry Go Instrumentation repository at :new-page:`https://opentelemetry.io/docs/instrumentation/go/manual/`.

.. note:: Custom OTel instrumentation is fully compatible with Splunk instrumentation and is fully supported by Splunk.
