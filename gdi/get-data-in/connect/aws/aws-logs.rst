  :description: Collect logs from your AWS services in Splunk.

Log collection is not available in Splunk Observability Cloud. 

Instead, you can use the Data Manager to send AWS logs to Splunk Platform. Learn how at :new-page:`Onboard AWS in Data Manager <https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/DM/1.8.2/User/AWSAbout>`. To query logs, use Log Observer Connect. See more at :ref:`logs-intro-logconnect`.

If you have a Log Observer entitlement, you must transition to Splunk Cloud Platform or Splunk Enterprise. Read more at :ref:`lo-transition`.
