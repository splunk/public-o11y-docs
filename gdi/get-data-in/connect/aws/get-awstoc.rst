Splunk Observability Cloud offers you several data ingestion and connection methods to monitor your Amazon Web Services (AWS) data. 

.. note:: If you want to send AWS data to the Splunk platform, use the Splunk add-on. Learn more at :new-page:`Splunk Add-on for AWS <https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/AddOns/released/AWS/Description>`.

Before you start, see :ref:`aws-prereqs`, and check the :ref:`Supported AWS integrations in Splunk Observability Cloud <aws-integrations>`.

    <h3>Constraints and limitations for data polling<a name="aws-metricstreams" class="headerlink" href="#aws-metricstreams" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
  </embed>

There are constraints to consider in terms of high data volume and filtering.

.. _aws-integration-amount:

.. raw:: html

  <embed>
    <h4>Number of installed AWS integrations <a name="aws-integration-amount" class="headerlink" href="#aaws-integration-amount" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
  </embed>

Splunk Observability Cloud doesn't limit the number of AWS service integrations you can configure. However, if you're planning to use over 100 AWS integrations, contact :ref:`support`.

.. _aws-data-limits:

.. raw:: html

  <embed>
    <h4>High data volume warning <a name="aws-data-limits" class="headerlink" href="#aws-data-limits" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
  </embed>

After you create an AWS integration, if it retrieves more than 100,000 metrics from CloudWatch, Splunk Observability Cloud automatically deactivates the integration and sends you a warning email.

This check runs once per integration. If you activate the integration afterwards, it will work correctly.

You can deactivate this check by setting the ``enableCheckLargeVolume`` field in the AWS integration to ``false`` using the API. See the :new-page:`API reference guide <https://dev.splunk.com/observability/reference/api/integrations/latest#endpoint-update-single-integration>` in the Splunk Observability developer docs.

.. raw:: html

  <embed>
    <h4>Tag filtering<a name="tag-filtering-aws" class="headerlink" href="#tag-filtering-aws" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
  </embed>

If you filter data based on tags, your costs for Amazon CloudWatch and Splunk Infrastructure Monitoring might decrease. Read more at :ref:`specify-data-metadata`.

    <h3>Constraints and limitations for streaming<a name="aws-metricstreams" class="headerlink" href="#aws-metricstreams" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
  </embed>

CloudWatch Metric Streams supports filtering by namespace and metric name but doesn't support filtering based on resource tags.

    <h2>Imported data<a name="aws-imported-data" class="headerlink" href="#aws-imported-data" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
  </embed>

By default, Splunk Observability Cloud brings in data from all supported AWS services associated with your account. See :ref:`Supported integrations in Splunk Observability Cloud <aws-integrations>`.

To manage the amount of data to import, see :ref:`aws-infra-import`.  

.. raw:: html

  <embed>
    <h3>Recommended stats<a name="aws-metricstreams" class="headerlink" href="#aws-metricstreams" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
  </embed>

If you're polling data, by default Splunk Observability Cloud only imports certain stats, which are based on AWS' own recommended stats and vary with each service. See the :ref:`list of recommended stats <aws-recommended-stats>` used by Splunk Observability Cloud.

If you're using Metric Streams, by default Splunk Observability Cloud streams all stats.

.. _aws-data-availability:

.. raw:: html

  <embed>
    <h2>Data availability<a name="aws-data-availability" class="headerlink" href="#aws-data-availability" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
  </embed>

.. caution:: Splunk Observability Cloud is not responsible for data availability. 
  
Depending on your configuration, it might take up to several minutes from the time you connect until you start seeing valid data from your account.

If you're streaming data with Metric Streams, the configured buffering settings on the Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream determine how long it takes for data to appear.

* Buffering is expressed in maximum payload size or maximum wait time, whichever is reached first. 
* If set to the minimum values (60 seconds or 1MB) the expected latency is within 3 minutes if the selected CloudWatch namespaces have active streams.

    <h2>Data collection interval and costs<a name="aws-collection-interval" class="headerlink" href="#aws-collection-interval" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
  </embed>

In most cases, metrics are reported every minute. However, some services use a different cadence. For example, selected S3 metrics are reported on a daily basis. Check the AWS documentation to verify how often your services' metrics are reported.

Collecting Amazon CloudWatch metrics through the polling APIs at the default polling rate of 300 seconds (5 minutes) is usually cheaper than using Metric Streams. On the other hand, if you set polling intervals to 1 minute, generally you see an increase in Amazon CloudWatch usage costs compared to Metric Streams.

Learn more at :ref:`Costs for AWS monitoring <aws-costs>`.

    <h2>Install the Splunk Distribution of the OpenTelemetry Collector<a name="install-splunk-otel-collector" class="headerlink" href="#install-splunk-otel-collector" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>

To take advantage of the full benefits of the Splunk Observability Cloud platform, install the :ref:`Splunk Distribution of the OpenTelemetry Collector <otel-intro>`.

    <h3>Track your OpenTelemetry enablement<a name="install-splunk-otel-collector-enablement" class="headerlink" href="#install-splunk-otel-collector-enablement" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
  </embed>

To track the degree of OpenTelemetry enablement in your AWS integrations: 

1. From Splunk Observability Cloud, go to :guilabel:`Data Management > Deployed integrations > AWS`.

2. Select either the :guilabel:`AWS EC2` or :guilabel:`AWS EKS` tabs to see whether the OTel Collector is installed on each AWS EC2 instance or AWS EKS cluster. This helps you identify the instances that still need to be instrumented.

3. For OTel Collector instances that are successfully instrumented, you can see which version of the Collector is deployed.
