   :description: Send Google Could Platform / GCP logs to Splunk.

Log collection is not available in Splunk Observability Cloud. 

Instead, you can use the Data Manager to send your GCP logs to Splunk Platform. Learn how at :new-page:`Onboard GCP in Data Manager <https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/DM/1.8.2/User/GCPAbout>`. To query logs, use Log Observer Connect. See more at :ref:`logs-intro-logconnect`.

If you have a Log Observer entitlement, you must transition to Splunk Cloud Platform or Splunk Enterprise. Read more at :ref:`lo-transition`.
