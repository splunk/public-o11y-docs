   :description: Learn how to send logs from your Azure services to Splunk.

Log collection is not available in Splunk Observability Cloud. 

Instead, you can use the Data Manager to send your Azure logs to Splunk Platform. Learn how at :new-page:`Onboarding for Azure data in Data Manager <https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/DM/1.8.2/User/StartConfigurationAzureAD>`. To query logs, use Log Observer Connect. See more at :ref:`logs-intro-logconnect`.

If you have a Log Observer entitlement, you must transition to Splunk Cloud Platform or Splunk Enterprise. Read more at :ref:`lo-transition`.
