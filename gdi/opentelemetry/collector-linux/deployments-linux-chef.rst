Deploy the Collector for Linux with Chef
********************************************************

  :description: Use Chef to install and configure the OpenTelemetry Collector to collect metrics, traces, and logs from Linux and Windows machines and send data to Splunk Observability Cloud.

Chef is a configuration management technology used to manage infrastructure on physical or virtual machines. Chef uses cookbooks to define a scenario. 

Cookbooks are fundamental working units of Chef, which consists of all the details related to working units, having the capability to modify configuration and the state of any system configured as a node on Chef infrastructure. Cookbooks can run multiple tasks.

Prerequisites
=========================

You need the following resources to use Chef:

* :ref:`Splunk Access Token <admin-org-tokens>`
* :new-page:`Splunk Realm <https://dev.splunk.com/observability/docs/realms_in_endpoints/>`
* Double-check exposed ports to make sure your environment doesn't have conflicts. You can change ports in the Collector configuration. See :ref:`otel-exposed-endpoints` for more information.

Install and use the Collector with Chef
============================================================

Download the Chef cookbook from the :new-page:`Chef Supermarket <https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/splunk_otel_collector>`, which is the site for community cookbooks. 

To install the Collector, include the ``splunk_otel_collector::default`` recipe in the ``run_list``, and set the attributes on the node's ``run_state``. The following is an example configuration that shows how to configure the required ``splunk_access_token`` attribute and some optional attributes:

.. code-block:: yaml

    {
        "splunk-otel-collector": {
            "splunk_access_token": "<SPLUNK_ACCESS_TOKEN>",
            "splunk_realm": "<SPLUNK_REALM>",
        }
    }

Attributes for Linux
===========================

For Linux, the cookbook accepts the attributes described in the following table:

.. list-table:: 
   :widths: 25 45 30
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Name
     - Description
     - Default value
   * - ``collector_version``
     - Version of the Collector package to install, for example, ``0.25.0``. The version should correspond to :new-page:`Github Releases <https://github.com/signalfx/splunk-otel-collector/releases>` without the preceding ``v``. Note that on Linux, the latest Collector version is installed if this parameter is not specified.
     - None
   * - ``gomemlimit``
     - Replaces ``splunk_ballast_size_mib`` starting in Collector version 0.97.0. It allows limiting memory usage in the GO runtime, helping enhance garbage collection and prevent out of memory situations. Learn more at :ref:`how to update memory ballast in your configuration <collector-upgrade-memory-ballast>`.
     - 90% of ``splunk_total_mem_mib``     
   * - ``splunk_access_token``
     - The Splunk access token to authenticate requests. This attribute is required.
     - None
   * - ``splunk_realm``
     - Which realm to send the data to, for example, ``us0``. The Splunk ingest and API URLs are inferred by this value. The ``SPLUNK_REALM`` environment variable is set with this value for the collector service. This attribute is required. To find your Splunk realm, see :ref:`Note about realms <about-realms>`.
     - None
   * - ``splunk_ingest_url``
     - Sets the Splunk ingest URL explicitly instead of the URL inferred by the ``$splunk_realm`` parameter. The ``SPLUNK_INGEST_URL`` environment variable is set with this value for the Collector service.
     - ``https://ingest.${splunk_realm}.signalfx.com``
   * - ``splunk_api_url``
     - Sets the Splunk API URL explicitly instead of the URL inferred by the ``$splunk_realm`` parameter. The ``SPLUNK_API_URL`` environment variable is set with this value for the Collector service.
     - ``https://api.${splunk_realm}.signalfx.com``
   * - ``splunk_trace_url``
     - Sets the Splunk trace endpoint URL explicitly instead of the URL inferred by the ``$splunk_ingest_url`` parameter. The ``SPLUNK_TRACE_URL`` environment variable is set with this value for the Collector service.
     - ``${splunk_ingest_url}/v2/trace``
   * - ``splunk_bundle_dir``
     - The path to the Smart Agent bundle directory. The default path is provided by the Collector package. If the specified path is changed from the default value, the path should be an existing directory on the node. The ``SPLUNK_BUNDLE_DIR`` environment variable is set to this value for the Collector service. 
     - ``/usr/lib/splunk-otel-collector/agent-bundle``
   * - ``splunk_collectd_dir``
     - The path to the collectd configuration directory for the Smart Agent bundle. The default path is provided by the Collector package. If the specified path is changed from the default value, the path should be an existing directory on the node. The ``SPLUNK_COLLECTD_DIR`` environment variable is set to this value for the Collector service. 
     - ``${splunk_bundle_dir}/run/collectd``
   * - ``splunk_memory_total_mib``
     - Total memory in MIB to allocate to the Collector; automatically calculates the ballast size. The ``SPLUNK_MEMORY_TOTAL_MIB`` environment variable is set to this value for the Collector service. 
     - ``512``
   * - ``splunk_ballast_size_mib``
     - ``splunk_ballast_size_mib`` is deprecated starting on Collector version 0.97.0. If you're using it, see :ref:`how to update your configuration <collector-upgrade-memory-ballast>`.
     - ``"``
   * - ``collector_config_source``
     - The source path to the Collector configuration YAML file. This file is copied to the ``$collector_config_dest`` path on the node. See the :new-page:`source attribute <https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/latest/types/file.html#file-attribute-source>` of the file resource for the supported value types. The default source file is provided by the Collector package.
     - ``/etc/otel/collector/agent_config.yaml``
   * - ``collector_config_dest``
     - Destination path of the Collector configuration file on the node. The ``SPLUNK_CONFIG`` environment variable is set with this value for the Collector service.
     - ``/etc/otel/collector/agent_config.yaml``
   * - ``node['splunk_otel_collector']['collector_config']``
     -  The Collector configuration object. Everything underneath this object gets directly converted to YAML and becomes the Collector configuration file. Using this option preempts ``collector_config_source`` functionality.
     -  ``{}``
   * - ``service_user`` and ``$service_group``
     - Sets the user or group ownership for the Collector service. The user or group is created if they do not exist.
     - ``splunk-otel-collector``
   * - ``package_stage``
     - The Collector package repository stage to use. Can be ``release``, ``beta``, or ``test``.
     - ``release``

Configure automatic discovery for back-end applications (Linux only)
--------------------------------------------------------------------

You can automatically instrument your back-end applications applications along with the Collector installation using automatic discovery. Automatic discovery removes the need to install and configure OpenTelemetry agents separately. See :ref:`discovery_mode` for more information.  The applications to be instrumented on the node need to be started or restarted separately after installation or any configuration changes for automatic discovery to take effect.

The following table shows the variables that can be configured with this Chef cookbook:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 50 30
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Name
     - Description
     - Default value
   * - ``with_auto_instrumentation``
     - Whether to install or manage automatic discovery for back-end applications. When set to ``true``, the ``splunk-otel-auto-instrumentation`` deb/rpm package is downloaded and installed from the Collector repository. To learn more, see :ref:`linux-backend-auto-discovery`.
     - ``false``
   * - ``with_auto_instrumentation_sdks``
     - The automatic discovery SDKs to install and activate. Note: ``dotnet`` is currently only supported for x86_64/amd64.
     - ``%w(java nodejs dotnet)``
   * - ``auto_instrumentation_version``
     - Version of the ``splunk-otel-auto-instrumentation`` package to install, for example, ``0.50.0``. The minimum supported version is ``0.48`` for Java, ``0.87.0`` for Node.js, and ``0.99.0`` for .NET.
     - ``latest``
   * - ``auto_instrumentation_systemd``
     - Whether to activate and configure the automatic discovery for ``systemd`` services only. If set to ``true``, the automatic discovery environment variables are added to ``/usr/lib/systemd/system.conf.d/00-splunk-otel-auto-instrumentation.conf``.
     - ``false``
   * - ``auto_instrumentation_ld_so_preload``
     - By default, the ``/etc/ld.so.preload`` file on the node is configured for the ``/usr/lib/splunk-instrumentation/libsplunk.so`` shared object library provided by the ``splunk-otel-auto-instrumentation`` package and is required for system-wide automatic discovery. Configure this variable to include additional library paths, for example, ``/path/to/my.library.so``.
     - ``''``
   * - ``auto_instrumentation_resource_attributes``
     - Configure the OpenTelemetry instrumentation resource attributes, for example, ``deployment.environment=prd,my.key=my.value`` (comma-separated string of ``key=value`` pairs). The specified resource attributes are added to the ``/etc/splunk/zeroconfig/node.conf`` configuration file on the node, or ``/usr/lib/systemd/system.conf.d/00-splunk-otel-auto-instrumentation.conf`` if using the ``systemd`` installation method.
     - ``''``
   * - ``auto_instrumentation_service_name``
     - Explicitly sets the service name for all instrumented applications on the node, for example, ``my.service``.
