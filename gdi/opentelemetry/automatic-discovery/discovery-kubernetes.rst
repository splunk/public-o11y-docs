    :description: Get started with automatic discovery and zero-code instrumentation for Kubernetes environments. Deploy automatic discovery and zero-code instrumentation to automatically find services and applications running in your environment and send data from them to Splunk Observability Cloud.

    <h2>Get started</h2>

To enable zero-code instrumentation of Java, Node.js, and .NET applications running on Kubernetes via auto discovery see :ref:`k8s-backend-auto-discovery`. With this option you won't have to install and configure your instrumentation agents separately. 

To use the Collector's automatic discovery of third-party applications in Kubernetes environments see :ref:`k8s-third-party`. With this option you'll only have to reuse a config file automatically generated by the Collector. 

.. note:: If you work in a Kubernetes environment and you're using the Collector version 0.109.0 or higher, log in to Splunk Observability Cloud and go to the :guilabel:`Discovered entities`` tab in the :guilabel:`Data Management` menu to see which of your services and third-party applications the Collector has detected and can monitor automatically.   

For a walkthrough of how to use automatic discovery and zero-code instrumentation to monitor an application in a Kubernetes environment, see :ref:`k8s-advanced-auto-discovery-config`.
