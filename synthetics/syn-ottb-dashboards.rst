The built-in dashboards show helpful metrics on your subscription usage, trends in your test data, and filter out the test metrics based on your organization. These built-in dashboards are a convenient way to answer questions like: 

* % of failed runs and run success rates by test 
* usage per organization on the volume of tests you run a month 
* total run counts 
* performance metrics and web vitals for Browser tests
