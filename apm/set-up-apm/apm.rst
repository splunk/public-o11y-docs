Monitor the availability and performance of your distributed applications by sending traces to Splunk APM. A trace contains one or more spans that log requests or transactions in your system. You can use trace data as the basis of dashboards, charts, and alerts, and you can correlate trace data with logs and other resources.

To set up Splunk APM and begin analyzing application availability and performance, follow these steps:
