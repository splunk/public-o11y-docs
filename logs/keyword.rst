  :description: Search and filter logs by keyword, field, or field values.


In Log Observer Connect, you can search Splunk platform logs that your Splunk platform role has permissions to see. If you cannot access a log in your Splunk platform instance, you cannot access it in Splunk Observability Cloud. If your Splunk Observability Cloud instance ingests logs, you can search Splunk Observability Cloud logs.

You can search for keywords, field names, or field values. To search your logs, follow these steps:

.. include:: /_includes/logs/query-logs.rst

When you add keywords, field names, or field values to the filters, Log Observer Connect narrows the results in the Timeline and the Logs table so that only records containing the selected fields and values appear. To learn how you can reuse a productive search in the future, see :ref:`logs-save-share`.
