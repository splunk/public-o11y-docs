   :description: Separate metric limits alerting for each product.

When you use more than one of the following products in Splunk Observability Cloud: Splunk APM, Splunk RUM, Splunk Synthetics, and Splunk Infrastructure Monitoring, each product has its own metric time series (MTS) creation limit. You can set up metric limits alerting to manage your resource usage on a per product basis.

The following table shows per product MTS creation limits.

.. note:: Splunk Infrastructure Monitoring MTS creation limit includes MTS generated by Network Explorer.

MTS creations per minute per product limit
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   * :strong:`Default limit value`: 6,000 or determined by your subscription.
   * :strong:`Notes`: Maximum number of MTS you can create per minute for each product. For example, if you create 5,500 MTS in the first minute for Infrastructure Monitoring, you can still create 5,500 more in the next minute. You can also create another 6,000 more MTS in the first minute for each other product you use.
