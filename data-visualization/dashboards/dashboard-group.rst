Create a dashboard group
=============================================================================

You can create a custom dashboard group for other people in your organization to have easy access to the dashboards in the group. You can create a dashboard group when you are saving a dashboard, or you can create a group from scratch.

To create a dashboard group from scratch, take the following steps:

#. Select :guilabel:`Dashboard Group` from the :strong:`Create` menu on the navigation bar.
#. Enter a name and (optionally) a description of the group.
#. Set write permissions if needed, then click :guilabel:`Create`. To learn more, see :ref:`about-permissions`.
#. After that, you land on a dashboard with the same name as the group. You can rename the dashboard from the dashboard's Actions menu (|more|), or begin adding charts to the group.

For more information on creating charts, see :ref:`simple-charts-dashboards` and :ref:`create-charts`.

To protect dashboards and dashboard groups from being edited or deleted by other members of your organization, you can specify which users and/or teams have permissions for them. For more information, see :ref:`about-permissions`.
