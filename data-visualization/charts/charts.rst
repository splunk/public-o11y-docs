Charts enable you to visualize the metrics or logs you can view in Splunk Observability Cloud.

A metric is anything that is measurable (you can assign a numerical value to it) and variable (changes over time). A log is an automatically generated, time-stamped record of each event relevant to a specific system. To learn more about Observability Cloud's data model, refer to :ref:`data-model`.

Charts can range from extremely simple (monitor a single metric for a single host in real time) to very sophisticated (apply advanced analytic formulas across several dimensions, compare values for different time periods, configure advanced display settings, and more).

The following sections lead you through developing the expertise you need to build charts that meet your requirements, based on the metrics you want to monitor.
