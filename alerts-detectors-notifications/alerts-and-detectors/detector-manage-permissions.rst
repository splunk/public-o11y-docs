To help you manage write permissions, Splunk Observability Cloud lets you view
grant and revoke permissions for detectors.

To learn more about write permissions, see :ref:`about-write-permissions`.

If you want to get write permission for a detector, or if you want to modify permissions,
first determine who already has permissions by displaying the :strong:`Permissions` list.
You need a user who has write permission to add you to the permissions list.

.. _display-write-permissions-detectors:

Display a detector permissions list
=============================================

To display the permissions list for a detector, follow these steps:

#. Open the detector.
#. Select the detector's actions menu (|more|), then select :menuselection:`Permissions`.

.. note:: You can open a detector from the :guilabel:`Detectors` tab on the :guilabel:`Alerts` page.


.. _grant-revoke-permissions:

Grant and revoke permissions for detectors
=========================================================

After you display a permissions list for a detector, you can start to grant or revoke write permissions
for users or teams. To grant or revoke permissions for a detector, you need write permission for the detector.

.. _procedure-grant-write-permissions:

Grant write permission for detectors
---------------------------------------------------------

To grant write permission for a detector, follow these steps:

#. Display the permissions for the item by selecting the detector's actions menu (|more|) and selecting :guilabel:`Permissions`.
#. To start using specific write permissions for a detector,
   uncheck :guilabel:`Anyone in this organization can edit`. You are now the
   only user who can edit the item.
#. Select :guilabel:`Add user or team`, then select the users or teams to whom
   you want to grant write permissions for the item.
#. Select :guilabel:`Save`

.. _procedure-revoke-write-permissions:

---------------------------------------------------------

To revoke write permissions for a detector, follow these steps:

#. To remove a user or team, select the :guilabel:`x` next to the user or team name.
#. Select :guilabel:`Save`

.. note:: Important

   You can remove your own write permission from a detector. However, if you're not an administrator, you can't grant yourself write permission again.
   Instead, you have to find someone else with write permission to grant you write permission.
