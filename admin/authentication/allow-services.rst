      :description: Options for securing your implementation, including proxies and allow lists for URLs and domains.    

A number of different services make up Splunk Observability Cloud. If your organization has stringent networking security policies that apply to sending data to third parties, use one of the following methods to ensure network access to Splunk Observability Cloud services:

- :ref:`simple-http-proxy`
- :ref:`otel-connector`

.. note:: If you write to http://domain/path, the request must happen on port 80. Similarly, if you write to https://domain/path, the request must happen on port 443. If you want to use a different port, you must use http[s]://domain:port/path

.. _simple-http-proxy:

Use a simple HTTP/HTTPS proxy
================================

If you can get out to the internet using a proxy, then using an HTTP/HTTPS proxy is your simplest option.

Ensure that you give the proxy the ability to resolve the network names and make outbound HTTP/HTTPS network connections to the URLs listed in :ref:`allow-urls` or the domains listed in :ref:`allow-domains`.

.. _otel-connector:

Use the Splunk Distribution of the OpenTelemetry Collector
=======================================================================

The :new-page:`Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector <https://docs.splunk.com/Observability/gdi/opentelemetry/deployment-modes.html>` supports proxies. You can configure proxies on each collector, or more typically, you would configure a collector in data forwarding (gateway) mode. In the gateway mode, you only need to configure the gateway collectors with the proxy settings; all other collectors can simply send data to the gateway collector.

Ensure that you give the Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector the ability to resolve the network names and make outbound HTTPS network connections to the URLs listed in :ref:`allow-urls` or the domains listed in :ref:`allow-domains`. Verify also the list of :ref:`exposed ports and endpoints <otel-exposed-endpoints>`.

.. _configure-proxy-collector:

Configure proxy settings for the Collector
----------------------------------------------

You might have to configure proxy settings for two separate actions:

- Download the Collector files, either through the installer script or manually.
- Allow the Collector to send telemetry through the inline or transparent proxy.

To configure proxy settings, set one of the following environment variables according to your needs and following the best practices for your environment and platform:

- ``HTTP_PROXY``: The HTTP proxy address
- ``HTTPS_PROXY``: The HTTPS proxy address
- ``NO_PROXY``: If you have a proxy, this option sets addresses that don't use the proxy

The following examples show how to set the ``HTTP_PROXY`` and ``HTTPS_PROXY`` environment variable for hosts and containers:

.. tabs::

   .. code-tab:: shell splunk-otel-collector.conf file (Systemd)

      # Edit the example systemd environment file in
      # /etc/otel/collector/splunk-otel-collector.conf.example

      NO_PROXY=<address,anotheraddress>
      HTTP_PROXY=http://<proxy.address:port>
      HTTPS_PROXY=http://<proxy.address:port>

   .. code-tab:: bash Linux (Systemd)

      # Add proxy settings to the environment for the installer script

      cat <<EOF | sudo tee -a /etc/environment
      NO_PROXY=<address,anotheraddress>
      HTTP_PROXY=http://<proxy.address:port>
      HTTPS_PROXY=http://<proxy.address:port>
      EOF

      # You might need to restart your shell session at this point.

      # Add proxy configuration to the service-proxy.conf
      # file in /etc/systemd/system/splunk-otel-collector.service.d/

      sudo mkdir -p /etc/systemd/system/splunk-otel-collector.service.d/

      cat <<EOF | sudo tee -a /etc/systemd/system/splunk-otel-collector.service.d/service-proxy.conf
      [Service]
      Environment="NO_PROXY=<address,anotheraddress>"
      Environment="HTTP_PROXY=http://<proxy.address:port>"
      Environment="HTTPS_PROXY=http://<proxy.address:port>"
      EOF

      # Reload systemd and splunk-otel-collector service afterwards

      sudo systemctl daemon-reload
      sudo systemctl restart splunk-otel-collector

   .. code-tab:: shell Windows

      # Set proxy settings for Collector communications

      [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable(“http_proxy”,”http://<proxy.address:port>”,”Machine”)
      [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("https_proxy","http://<proxy.address:port>","Machine")
      [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("no_proxy","<address>","Machine")
      netsh winhttp set proxy "http://<proxy.address:port>"

      # Set proxy settings to download Collector files

      Set-ItemProperty -Path 'HKCU:\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings' -name ProxyServer -Value "http://<proxy.address:port>"
      Set-ItemProperty -Path 'HKCU:\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings' -name ProxyEnable -Value 1

              # Set the proxy address, respectively for http_proxy and https_proxy environment variables
              # It must be a full URL like http://user:pass@10.0.0.42. Not used by Ansible itself.
              splunk_otel_collector_proxy_http: proxy.address:<port>
              splunk_otel_collector_proxy_https: proxy.address:<port>
              # Set the ip or hosts that don't use proxy settings. Only used if splunk_otel_collector_proxy_http
              # or splunk_otel_collector_proxy_https is defined. Default is localhost,127.0.0.1,::1)
              splunk_otel_collector_no_proxy): 127.0.0.1

Restart the Collector after adding these environment variables to your configuration.


.. _allow-urls:

URLs to allow in your network
================================



.. raw:: html

   <div class="include-start" id="realm-note.rst"></div>

.. include:: /_includes/realm-note.rst

.. raw:: html

   <div class="include-stop" id="realm-note.rst"></div>




If your organization's networking security policies require you to individually allow services delivered over the internet, ensure that you allow the following service URLs on your network:

.. code:: shell

   \*.signalfx.com

   \*.<YOUR_REALM>.signalfx.com

You also need to allow the following URLs:

* packages.treasuredata.com
* splunk.jfrog.io 
* jfrog-prod-use1-shared-virginia-main.s3.amazonaws.com

If you're unable to allow all the URLs listed in this section, see :ref:`allow-domains`.

.. _allow-domains:

Domains to allow in your network
==================================================

If you're unable to allow all URLs as described in :ref:`allow-urls`, ensure that you allow the following domains on your network:
