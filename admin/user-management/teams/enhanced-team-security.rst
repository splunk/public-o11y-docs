Turn on enhanced team security

By default, every user can join any team in your organization. If you want to restrict users from being able to join any team, you can turn on the enhanced team security setting. Turning on the enhanced team security setting also makes the Team Manager role available to teams.

Team Manager role is not part of role-based access control (RBAC). The Team Manager role allows an individual to run administrative tasks for the team. For example, editing the team description, adding or removing team members, and modifying the team notification policies. These permissions apply only to the team they are a member of and do not apply across the entire organization. 
  
To learn more about team roles and permissions, see :ref:`about-team-roles`.

You must be a Splunk Observability Cloud administrator to apply this setting. This setting applies to every team in your organization.

To turn on the enhanced team security setting, follow these steps:

#. Log in to Splunk Observability Cloud.

#. In the left navigation menu, select :menuselection:`Settings > General Settings`.

#. Select the :guilabel:`Restrict Access` check box.


.. _about-team-roles:

Team roles and permissions
============================================================================

This table presents the available team roles and their permissions. Some team roles and permissions change based on whether enhanced team security is turned on. For example, when you turn on enhanced team security, the Team Manager role is available, and Splunk Observability Cloud administrators or Team Managers must add users.

.. note:: You can't promote a team member with the ``read_only`` RBAC role to team manager. For more information about RBAC roles, see :ref:`about-team-roles`.

To learn more about enabling enhanced team security, see :ref:`admin-team-controls`.
