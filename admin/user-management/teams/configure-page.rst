   :description: Learn how to view and configure an associated landing page that contains information relevant to team members.

Every team has a landing page that contains information relevant to team members. A landing page brings together dashboard groups and alerts triggered by detectors that are linked to the team. The landing page has the following sections:

* A list of services managed by your team. 

* A count of active alerts from detectors linked to the team, grouped by severity.

* Links to one or more dashboard groups linked to the team.

Anyone can view the landing page for any team.
